Do you love text based tools and softwares?

Do you love linux terminal? Have you ever wandered why so few CLI applications for day-to-day use, like music-players, video-players, file managers, etc. 

What about a library focused to help in such matter?

We, as passionate **nix-like** users and *Free Software* developers and who like to solve things the old and good way...using the *terminal*!


### Like the saying goes: 

#### "Where there is a shell, there is a way"
